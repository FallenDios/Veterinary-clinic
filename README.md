This algorithm processes data on animals admitted to a veterinary clinic, tracking the youngest and oldest ages, and calculating the percentage of a specific animal type. If no animals are admitted, it displays a message. The algorithm includes alternative and repetitive structures and was created for a university exercise. It can be executed in two similar ways, with slight structural differences.
